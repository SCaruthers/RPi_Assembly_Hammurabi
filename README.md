Project for coding Hammurabi game in ARM Assembly on Raspberry Pi

# Hammurabi
Arm Assembly implementation of the old text-based computer game.

It was first developed under the name King of Sumeria or The Sumer Game by Doug Dyment in 1968 at Digital Equipment Corporation as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language.

Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL language, but around 1971 David H. Ahl ported it to DEC BASIC and in 1973 published it in 101 BASIC Games. This was later republished in Microsoft BASIC form in 1978's BASIC Computer Games. His expanded version of the game, titled Hammurabi, quickly became the more prominent version due to the popularity of both the book and the programming language. Hammurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games.

Hammurabi (C. 1810 BCâ€“1750 BC) is best known for the development of a code of laws known as the Code of Hammurabi, which was used to regulate Mesopotamian society.  Read more at https://www.biography.com/political-figure/hammurabi or https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/hammurabi 

This current project is intended as an instruction in applying basic learning in ARM Assembly, using the tools, such as 'gcc' available by default in Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian).

The code demonstrates the basics of register use, global variables, C function calls, subroutines, and floating point (FPU) division.
